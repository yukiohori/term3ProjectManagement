				<h2>Hi I'm Ahmed Hindawy</h2>
				<p>My name is Ahmed Hindawy, I am a business school graduate with over 10 years of work experience as
					 a business analyst. I have decided it was never too late to chase  my dream to learn digital art 
					 and persue a career in the game industry.
				</p>
				<p>I left Cairo, Egpyt and moved to Vancouver, 
					Canada where I joined Vancouver Institute of Media Arts (VanArts) where I am currently living and studing.
				</p>
				<p>I have always been facinated by video games and would often wonder about how are they made. 
					My first step was discovering level editors, but later on I was fasinated by 3D programs. 
					For me creating art for games is a passion that is coming true.
